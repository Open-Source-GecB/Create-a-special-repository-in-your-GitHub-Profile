**Step 1:-** <code>In order to be able to create the special repository, you will need to ensure that your Repository name is the *same* as your username</code><br>For example, since my GitHub username is Rishabh062, I named my Repository name Rishabh062 as well.<br>Once you enter your username, a message will pop up which lett you know that it is a special repository!<br>*Now make sure that the repository is public and youâ€™ve initialized it with a README file.*<br>

**Step 2:-** <code>Once the repository has been created, you will now be able to see the README.md file</code><br>GitHub commits the README.md file with **Hi there ðŸ‘‹** by default. We can now edit the file.<br>

**Step 3:-**<code>In order to edit the README file, some prior of markdown syntax would help.</code><br>You can refer this [cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pd) which is provided by GitHub to assist you.
